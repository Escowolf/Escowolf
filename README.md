<h1>Ezequiel Sousa</h1>

<p>My focus of interest has been data persistence, integration via API, requirements gathering, data analysis, integrations, and metadata analysis. I also have a slight flirtation with UX. I am proactive in identifying and resolving problems, always looking for new ways to improve routines and operations.</p>
